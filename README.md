- 😄 Pronouns: he, him, you
- ⚡ Fun fact: God exists and his number (3) is plainly evident throughout the universe, and I studied science at Cambridge Uni, and so I am almost as clever as Sheldon IMO.
- It is not just that fact makes me sure God exists, the habitable life Universe is so astronomically unlikely 
- (and I do mean very very very very very unlikely with loads of zeroes before it).
- The multiverse WAS created by a desperate atheist, so desperate to try and remove the proof that others had found for God's existence.     
-  LAW of Conservation of Energy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy
So desperate because he forgot about the Conservation in a closed system, the Universe or Universes in the case of the 'so-called' multiverse. The same LAW which is was proven by science! 

- When they predicted and then discovered the existence of a neutrino (something I'm convinced they'll never do for the multiverse!)

God really exists and I can prove it! Whereas the all the new atheists have zero, they do not and almost certainly cannot have any proof for the multiverse theory! Therefore it should never be taught as if it were science!
